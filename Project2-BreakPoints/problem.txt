Media queries can get complex, especially when they start overlapping like what we're got here. Let's go ahead and step through each part step by step.

AA applies from 0 to 300, and also from 300 to 400. This makes its maximum width 400 pixels.
BB starts at 301 pixels, so we set its minimum width to 301, and it goes all the way to 600 pixels (its maximum width).
CC starts at 601 pixels, so we say it has a minimum width of 601 pixels. And, it doesn't have to end -- so there is no maximum width.
DD seems to be the same as CC, except it starts at 961 pixels.
